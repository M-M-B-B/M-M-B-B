- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @M-M-B-B
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in dogs and their behavior!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as possible about creating a website.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: funny, helpful, empathic
- âš¡ Fun fact: Dogs are also left-"pawed" and right-"pawed"! However, the proportions between left- and right-pawed animals are balanced at 1/3 each. Additionally, 30% prefer no paw.
